## Requirements:
1. OS Windows/Linux/Mac.
2. MATLAB R2019/R2020.

## Simulations
In order to replicate results in the paper for the Lecco province, run the **main_lecco.m** file
by setting the *tracking_rate* and *testing_rate* parameters as in the paper.
If you are interested in simulating for a new region then open **main.m** file, set new parameters
and run it.
